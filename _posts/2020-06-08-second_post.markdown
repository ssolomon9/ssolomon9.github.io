How is First Mile a metaphor for life?


The first mile is something you need to complete to firmly convince yourself that you're staying true to the path you decided. It is after troughing through the first mile, that you decide that you can last to the next mile and push even further to reach your goal. Once you make it past your first challenge, it becomes easier to keep your will to make it through all others.Â

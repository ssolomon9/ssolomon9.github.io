There are several reasons why I've become interested in software engineering. The first is a curiosity in functionality, I've always looked inside, and research things to see how they work, and what is used to build it. I would look at websites and wonder how they were built, and if I could do the same. The second was the challenge, I need to be challenged to stimulate my creativity and solve problems, and software engineering is a constant challenge it is both frustrating and interesting how the smallest thing wrong in a program can stop it from working. Breaking and fixing these problems is fun and helps me think of alternative solutions. Third and is creativity, I want to build things that positively affect the world and solve global problems. Forth and last I know the importance of finding a career you can grow, advance and enjoy.
